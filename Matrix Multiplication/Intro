This program computes the result of two given matrices multiplication using the two-phase approach.
To run this script, you need to first compile it to get a jar, and then run the following script:
bin/hadoop jar jar_name.jar TwoPhase mat-A mat-B output
Both mat-A and mat-B are directories containing matrix value stored as a .txt file.
After running this program, your output will be stored in a directory named output.
You need to make sure that there wasn't a directory named output before.
